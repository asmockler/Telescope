# Telescope

:telescope: Helps you find some spectacles.

With one click, you get personal texts whenever spectacles locations are announced.

## Deploy to Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Click the button above and Heroku will help you deploy the app. Once deployed, open the scheduler add-on and add `bin/telescope` at the frequency you want (I have mine set to run hourly).
